## Most people use ML/DL to solve problems ...
_classification, unsupervised learning, regression, ... _

## Machines are people too!
not really...
but what happens if you start treating them as such?

## Garbage-in garbage-out
Let's get more nuanced, what if the input data shapes their *personality*...

## My people
Each bot is a book...

!(images/dorthy_glitch.mp4) <<height:300px;transparent>> Frank Baum bot
!(images/wuthering_heights.mp4) <<height:300px;transparent>> Emily BrontÃ« bot
!(images/poe_head.mp4) <<height:300px;transparent>> Edgar Allen Poe bot

  
What happens when one bot reads the book of the other?

## Methodology

### Data collection
Top 100 books from last month from [project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
%and [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)
Manually cleaned headers, footers, and forwards (unsexy data science)

### Model
Used `tensorflow` and `tflearn` to build a LSTM-RNN
128 wide two-layer network, length 15, max 500K input samples, 100K test
bot2bot similarity calculated by as the average cross-entropy loss
of one model reading the others test set

## Bots get *confused* when they see new text.

## We use confusion to measure *author similarity*.

# Where to go from here?

### More data! Collect more books, sort from [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/).

### Correlate measure with same author / same time period.

### What is being measured? Style, syntax, word choice, ...?
